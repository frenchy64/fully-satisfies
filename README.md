# fully-satisfies

Utilities for Clojure.

- [fully-satisfies?](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.html#var-fully-satisfies.3F) -- a variant of `clojure.core/satisfies?` that also checks if a value implements all methods in the protocol (considering direct, extended, and metadata methods).
- [partially-satisfies?](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.html#var-partially-satisfies.3F) -- a variant of `clojure.core/satisfies?` that is [compatible with metadata extension](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2426).
- [somef](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.somef.html#var-somef) -- a variant of `clojure.core/some-fn` that has a simple operational equivalence, a zero-arity, and [consistent return values](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2634).
- [everyp](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.everyp.html#var-everyp) -- a variant of `clojure.core/every-pred` that has a simple operational equivalence, and a zero-arity.
- [never?](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.never.html#var-never.3F) -- a predicate `never?` that always returns false.
- [run-all!](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.run-all.html#var-run-all.21) -- a variant of `clojure.core/run!` that does not [short-circuit on reduced](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2574).
- [clearing-future](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.clearing-future.html#var-clearing-future) -- a variant of `clojure.core/future` that clears conveyed bindings after execution, resolving a [known memory leak](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2619).
- [deftest](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.uncaught-testing-contexts.html#var-deftest.2Breport-uncaught-contexts), [testing](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.uncaught-testing-contexts.html#var-testing.2Brecord-uncaught-contexts) -- drop-in replacements for `clojure.test/{deftest,testing}` that [report the testing context on uncaught exceptions](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2525).
- [folda](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.folda.html#var-folda) -- a variant of `clojure.core/areduce` that [supports naming the array](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-115).
- [def-shared-protocol](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.shared-protocol.html#var-def-shared-protocol) -- a variant of `clojure.core/defprotocol` whose [methods can see future extensions](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1796).
- non-overflowing [vector](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.vector-overflow.html#var-vector), [vec](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.vector-overflow.html#var-vec) -- a vector implementation that [consistently handles integer overflow cases](https://ask.clojure.org/index.php/11080/get-find-assoc-vectors-overflows-key-when-passed-large-longs), resolving [a known general attack vector](https://ask.clojure.org/index.php/11080/get-find-assoc-vectors-overflows-key-when-passed-large-longs?show=11084#a11084) caused by [undefined behavior](https://ask.clojure.org/index.php/11080/get-find-assoc-vectors-overflows-key-when-passed-large-longs?show=11081#a11081).
- [latest protocol ops](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.latest-protocol.html) -- implementations of `satisfies?`, `find-protocol-impl`, `find-protocol-method`, `extends?`, `extenders` that look up the latest version of the protocol [such that they have the same behavior with partial](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2094).
- non-leaky [clojure.core](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.non-leaky.clojure.core.html), [clojure.test](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.non-leaky.clojure.test.html) macros -- versions of the following macros that don't leak implementation details (eg., recur targets, pre/post, try/catch syntax): `locking` ([upstream report](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2573)), `binding`, `with-bindings`, `sync`, `with-local-vars`, `with-in-str`, `dosync`, `with-precision`, `with-loading-context`, `with-redefs`, `delay`, `vswap!`, `lazy-seq`, `lazy-cat`, `future`, `pvalues`, `clojure.test/{deftest,deftest-,testing,with-test,with-test-out}`, `clojure.java.shell/with-sh-{dir,env}`, `clojure.test.tap/with-tap-output`, `clojure.pprint/with-pprint-dispatch`, `clojure.core.async/thread`, `clojure.core.logic.pldb/with-{db,dbs}`

## Usage

### fully-satisfies?

[Docstring](https://frenchy64.github.io/fully-satisfies/latest/io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.html#var-fully-satisfies.3F)

```clojure
(require '[io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies :refer [fully-satisfies?]])

(defprotocol A
  (a [this])
  (b [this]))

(fully-satisfies? A (reify))
;=> false
(fully-satisfies? A (reify A))
;=> false
(fully-satisfies? A (reify A (a [this])))
;=> false
(fully-satisfies? A (reify A (a [this]) (b [this])))
;=> true
```

### run-all!

```clojure
(require '[io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies.run-all :refer [run-all!]])

(run-all! println [1 (reduced 2) 3])
;1
;2
;3
;=> nil
;; does not short-circuit on reduced
(run-all! println [1 (reduced 2) 3])
;1
;#object[clojure.lang.Reduced 0x3deeac1 {:status :ready, :val 2}]
;3
;=> nil
```

## Releasing

1. Change project.clj version to desired version + SNAPSHOT
   - eg., `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
2. Commit with message `Release {:major,:minor,:patch}`
   - this releases the current version then bumps to the next `{:major,:minor,:patch}` SNAPSHOT
3. Pull

## Thanks

Thanks [Wanderson Ferreira](https://github.com/wandersoncferreira) for the idea of `fully-satisfies?` and its name. My initial stance that `fully-satisifes?` was impossible to implement quickly proved to be incorrect after Wanderson's asked the right questions and decompiled some bytecode.

Wanderson and [Mark Herman, II](https://github.com/turbodog99) also helped improve early iterations of `fully-satisfies?`.
