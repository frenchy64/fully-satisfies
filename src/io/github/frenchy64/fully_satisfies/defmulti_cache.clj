(defmacro defmulti
  "Creates a new multimethod with the associated dispatch function.
  The docstring and attr-map are optional.

  Options are key-value pairs and may be one of:

  :default

  The default dispatch value, defaults to :default

  :hierarchy

  The value used for hierarchical dispatch (e.g. ::square is-a ::shape)

  Hierarchies are type-like relationships that do not depend upon type
  inheritance. By default Clojure's multimethods dispatch off of a
  global hierarchy map.  However, a hierarchy relationship can be
  created with the derive function used to augment the root ancestor
  created with make-hierarchy.

  Multimethods expect the value of the hierarchy option to be supplied as
  a reference type e.g. a var (i.e. via the Var-quote dispatch macro #'
  or the var special form)."
