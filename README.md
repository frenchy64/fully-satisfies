# fully-satisfies

Provides a variant of `clojure.core/satisfies?` that also checks if a value implements all methods in the protocol.

## Dependency

Available on [Clojars](https://clojars.org/io.github.frenchy64/fully-satisfies).

Leiningen:

```clojure
[io.github.frenchy64/fully-satisfies "1.0.1"]
```

Clojure CLI:

```clojure
  :deps {io.github.frenchy64/fully-satisfies 
         {:git/tag "1.0.1", :git/sha "093fbe49ff8dcb4d7cbf78b32c80c206c36ac840"}}
```

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[io.github.frenchy64.fully-satisfies :refer [fully-satisfies?]])

(defprotocol A
  (a [this])
  (b [this]))

(fully-satisfies? A (reify))
;=> false
(fully-satisfies? A (reify A)))
;=> false
(fully-satisfies? A (reify A (a [this]))))
;=> false
(fully-satisfies? A (reify A (a [this]) (b [this]))))
;=> true
```

## Releasing

1. Change project.clj version to desired version + SNAPSHOT
   - eg., `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
2. Commit with message `Release {:major,:minor,:patch}`
   - this releases the current version then bumps to the next `{:major,:minor,:patch}` SNAPSHOT
3. Pull
4. Update `README.md`

## Thanks

Thanks [Wanderson Ferreira](https://github.com/wandersoncferreira) for the idea and name. My initial stance that this was impossible to implement quickly proved to be incorrect after Wanderson's asked the right questions and decompiled some bytecode.

Wanderson and [Mark Herman, II](https://github.com/turbodog99) also helped improve early iterations.
